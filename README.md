# Custom Super Buffer for ArcGIS Pro
This script runs multiple custom buffers in one action. The input is a single feature class file ('param0' within the script), and there are three fields for entering buffer distances. This script can be customized to have fewer buffer distance options by reducing parameters. For a single buffer distance, only keep 'param1' within the script.

**Tools**: ArcGIS Pro, VS Code
